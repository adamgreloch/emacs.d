;;; Commentary:

;; This is my personal startup file for GNU Emacs.  It has only recently
;; been tested on GNU Emacs 26.3. Since I'm a total beginner in GNU Emacs,
;; beware of newbie moves.

;;; Code:

(use-package web-mode)

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jsx?$" . web-mode))
(setq web-mode-content-types-alist '(("jsx" . "\\.js[x]?\\'")))
(defun web-mode-init-hook ()
  "Hooks for Web mode.  Adjust indent."
  (setq web-mode-markup-indent-offset 4))
  
(add-hook 'web-mode-hook  'web-mode-init-hook)

(use-package flycheck)

(setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers
              (append flycheck-disabled-checkers
                      '(javascript-jshint json-jsonlist)))

;; Enable eslint checker for web-mode
(flycheck-add-mode 'javascript-eslint 'web-mode)

;; Enable flycheck globally
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

(use-package add-node-modules-path)

(add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook 'add-node-modules-path)

(use-package company)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)

(provide 'module-web-mode)
